done for the assignment evaluation connectPlus within 24 hours
uploading images or video to firebase fails don't know why the same code works with my other apps 

    // let id1 = description+ Math.random();
    // const response = await fetch(media);
    // const blob = await response.blob();
    // var ref = firebase.storage().ref(`${userId}`).child(id1);
    // const picurl = await ref.put(blob);
    // var url = await ref.getDownloadURL();

here is the code 

The app is not perfect but that's the best i can do in 24 hours have given my 100% to it hope you like it
