uploading images or video to firebase fails don't know why the same code works with my other apps 

    // let id1 = description+ Math.random();
    // const response = await fetch(media);
    // const blob = await response.blob();
    // var ref = firebase.storage().ref(`${userId}`).child(id1);
    // const picurl = await ref.put(blob);
    // var url = await ref.getDownloadURL();

here is the code 

I managed to get the image/video upload with different code also there is no lazy loading in my app so you may see black blocks until the media is loading


The app is not perfect but that's the best i can do in 24 hours have given my 100% to it hope you like it
